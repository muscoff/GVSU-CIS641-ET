# ET

Project description (~1 paragraph)
ET is just a simple web app (e-commerce app) that is going to empower students residing at campus housing to sell valuable items of theirs instead of leaving it at the reception during move-out

During my first semester stay at campus housing, most students leave valuable items behind during every move-out and for most of them, their excuse for leaving it behind is simply because they don't have anyone to sell it to and they do not want to carry it all the way back home since some are out of state.

The ET platform aims at providing students the opportunity to sell valuable items in perfect to good condition to other residents and get some cash back on their valuables.
