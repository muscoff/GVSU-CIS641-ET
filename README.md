# ET

Project description (~1 paragraph)
ET is just a simple web app (e-commerce app) that is going to empower students residing at campus housing to sell valuable items of theirs instead of leaving it at the reception during move-out

During my first semester stay at campus housing, most students leave valuable items behind during every move-out and for most of them, their excuse for leaving it behind is simply because they don't have anyone to sell it to and they do not want to carry it all the way back home since some are out of state.

The ET platform aims at providing students the opportunity to sell valuable items in perfect to good condition to other residents and get some cash back on their valuables.

## Prerequisites
The frontend and backend of the app are in the src folder.
It is expected to have node and npm already installed on your machine.

It is required that upon unzipping both the frontend and backend zip files,
you run "npm install" in the terminal of both folders to install all the necessary dependencies of each app.

## Run Instructions

### Frontend Run Instructions
After successfully running "npm install" in the frontend folder to install all the required dependencies that the app needs, you can run the app by
running the command "npm start" in the terminal.

This would start the app locally and the app can be accessed in the browser via "localhost:3000".


### Backend Run Instructions
After successfully running "npm install" in the backend folder to install all the required dependencies that the app needs, you can run the app by
running the command "npm run dev" in the terminal to start the app locally in a development mode or you can also run "npm start" which would equally start the backend app.
