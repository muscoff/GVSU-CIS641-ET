# [Change Management Plan](https://github.com/muscoff/GVSU-CIS641-ET/blob/main/artifacts/Change_Management_Plan.pdf)

## Training
The ET â€“ Platform is actually an easy to use application that enables buyers and sellers to easily onboard themselves on the app without any extra tutorials or help.
ET is a simple app that fulfills the standard e-commerce app that most people have interacted with.
On the front page of the app, it states the main and core purpose of the way. After navigating to the appropriate page(either users or admin), there is a simple form that is self-explanatory which requires users to create an account before using the app. This process is same if it is a seller that wants to use the app.

## Integration
Integrating the app into the ecosystem is quite simple as the API endpoint writing for this application is simple and straightforward. For database, this application is using a json file as its database. Hence, if someone want to implement a different database into the software, they only need to change the read and write to the file to link to their new or existing database and everything will smoothly run without any issues.

## Issues
The app is simple although it functions like a normal big e-commerce app. The files are written in plain, simple javascript and so, updating or resolving issues is a simple google search. I must add that there are no complicated dependencies been used and so, there is little to no issues to be discovered with the app since it does not depend on external dependencies that could break in the future.
