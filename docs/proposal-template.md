# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
ET is just a simple web app (e-commerce app) that is going to empower students residing at campus housing to sell valuable items of theirs instead of leaving it at the reception during move-out.

During my first semester stay at campus housing, most students leave valuable items behind during every move-out and for most of them, their excuse for leaving it behind is simply because they don't have anyone to sell it to and they do not want to carry it all the way back home since some are out of state.

The ET platform aims at providing students the opportunity to sell valuable items in perfect to good condition to other residents and get some cash back on their valuables.

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)
I will be using the following technologies:
- React (To build the frontend)
- Firebase (To support my app for data/file storage)

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)
I plan on developing the central pieces of the app first in the following order
- Admin portal: This would include the login and registration pages for users
- Admin Dashboard: This would be the interface for registered users to navigate and upload the necessary resources for the users to see on the main page
- The front facing pages for the general users
- Construct my verification and validation methods
- Implement the final phase of authention in the app and merge everything together

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)
Major milestone include:
- Ensuring all the necessary packages needed for the app is installed without any issues (1weeks)
- Ensuring the core functionality of the app which include enabling users to upload their items for display is working without issues and that users are able to see it at the front facing page (3weeks)
-

# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
- Package dependencies possibly not working well together.
